SamKnows \footnote{\url{http://www.samknows.com}} specializes in the
deployment of hardware-based probes that perform measurements to assess the
performance of broadband access networks. The probes function by performing
active measurements when the user is less aggresively using the network.  RIPE
Atlas \footnote{\url{https://atlas.ripe.net}} is another independent
measurement infrastructure deployed by \ac{RIPE NCC}. It consists of thousands
of probes distributed around the globe that perform \ac{RTT} and traceroute
measurements to a number of preconfigured destinations alongside DNS queries
to root DNS servers.

% measurement lab
\ac{M-Lab} \cite{dovrolis:2010} is an open, distributed platform to deploy
internet measurement tools and the resulting measurement data on Google'
storage infrastructure. The tools vary from measuring TCP throughput and
available bandwidth to emulating clients to identify end-user traffic
differentiation policies \cite{dischinger:2010, kanuparthy:2011} to performing
reverse traceroute lookups from arbitrary destinations \cite{bassett:2010}.
All of the collected data is available in the public domain.

The answers to the aforementioned research questions will only materialize
with access to an available large-scale measurement platform. We as partners
of the Leone \footnote{\url{http://leone-project.eu}} consortium, will
leverage the infrastructure of our partners: BT
\footnote{\url{http://www.bt.com}}, TI
\footnote{\url{http://www.telecomitalia.com}} and SamKnows. The developed
measurement tests will be deployed not only in our partner's ISP's network,
but also in the already deployed SamKnows global infrastructure.  The SamKnows
infrastructure already has several thousand probes in the homes of broadband
customers, and will continue to grow during the STREP lifetime.
