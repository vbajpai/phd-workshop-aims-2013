SamKnows\footnote{\url{http://www.samknows.com}} specializes in the deployment
of hardware-based probes that perform measurements to assess the performance
of broadband access networks. The probes function by performing active
measurements when the user is not aggressively using the network.  RIPE
Atlas\footnote{\url{https://atlas.ripe.net}} is another independent
measurement infrastructure deployed by the \ac{RIPE NCC}. It consists of
thousands of hardware probes distributed around the globe that perform
\ac{RTT} and traceroute measurements to a number of preconfigured destinations
alongside DNS queries to DNS root servers.

% measurement lab
\ac{M-Lab} \cite{dovrolis:2010} is an open, distributed platform to deploy
internet measurement tools. The measurement results are stored on Google'
infrastructure. The tools vary from measuring TCP throughput and available
bandwidth to emulating clients to identify end-user traffic differentiation
policies \cite{dischinger:2010, kanuparthy:2011} to performing reverse
traceroute lookups from arbitrary destinations \cite{bassett:2010}.  All of
the collected data is available in the public domain.

The answers to the aforementioned research questions will only materialize
with access to a large-scale measurement platform. We as partners of the
Leone\footnote{\url{http://leone-project.eu}} consortium, will leverage the
infrastructure of our partners. The developed measurement tests will be
deployed not only in our partner's \ac{ISP}'s network, but also in the already
deployed SamKnows global infrastructure.  The SamKnows infrastructure already
has several thousand probes in the homes of broadband customers, and will
continue to grow during the project' lifetime.
