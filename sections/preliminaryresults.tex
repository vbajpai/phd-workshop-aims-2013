A dual-stacked user when attempting to connect to a dual-stacked service
traditionally prefers connecting over IPv6. This is because in POSIX systems,
the domain name resolution system call \texttt{getaddrinfo(\ldots)} returns a
list of endpoints in an order that prioritizes an IPv6-upgrade path
\cite{rfc6724}. The dictated order can dramatically reduce the application
responsiveness in situations where IPv6 connectivity is broken. This is
because, the attempt to connect over an IPv4 endpoint will take place only
when the IPv6 connection attempt has timed out, which can be in the order of
seconds.

This noticeable degraded user experience can be subverted by making
applications apply the happy eyeballs algorithm \cite{rfc6555}. The algorithm
recommends that a dual-stacked application resolves the DNS names of a
dual-stacked service for both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints at once. If the resolver
returns both endpoints, the application must try a TCP
\texttt{connect(\ldots)} to both the endpoints pick the one that
completes first. The connection attempt does prefer the first resolved
address family (usually IPv6) by the order of 300ms though.

In this pursuit, to determine whether applications will use IPv4 or IPv6 on a
dual stacked service, we developed \texttt{happy}, a simple TCP happy eyeballs
probing tool. It uses non-blocking \texttt{connect(\ldots)} calls to establish
concurrent connections to a number of possible endpoints of a service.
%The tool, however, does not check whether the endpoints of a given target all
%provide the same service. Hence, it is possible to impact the results by
%setting up fake servers that do not provide the service tested and which are
%designed and deployed with the only purpose to provide fast connection setup
%times and redirect services.
We have cross-compiled \texttt{happy} for the OpenWRT
\footnote{\url{https://openwrt.org}} platform. As a result, the tool can now
be run on widely deployed SamKnows probes and the collected measurement data
can be further analysed. In order to ascertain the value in this exercise, we
prepared an internal test-bed of multiple measurement points. The measurement
points have different flavors of IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity ranging from
native IPv4, native IPv6, IPv6 tunnel broker endpoints, Teredo and tunnelled
IPv4. We used the top 100 DNS names compiled by Hurricane Electric Internet
Services \footnote{\url{http://bgp.he.net/ipv6-progress-report.cgi}} and ran
\texttt{happy} on the set of dual-stack services represented by these DNS
names.

A preliminary result comparing the preference of a happy-eyeballed application
to IPv6 and IPv4 from two measurement points is shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:happy-v4-v6-compete}. The initial results show that happy eyeballs
prevents IPv6 access to Facebook, with only a 20\% chance to get to Google
related services over a Teredo Tunnel. The results look more promising on a
native IPv6 connection. It is important to note that adhering to the happy
eyeballs recommendation, IPv6 endpoints are allowed a 300ms chance to succeed.
A result comparing the time (mean and standard deviation) to make a TCP
connection to each of the services from the same measurement points shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:happy-v4-v6-mean-std}. The initial results show higher time
variances when connections are made over IPv6. In addition, it appears, some
of the related (and few of the unrelated) services show similar preferences.
These services either resolve to the same endpoint or a set of endpoints that
belong to the same allocated endpoint. Digging through the \texttt{whois}
information for each of the endpoints from their \ac{RIR} seems to indicate
that major portion of the services map to allocated prefixes owned by popular
organizations like Google and Akamai Technologies as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:v4-v6-cloud}.

%As much as it is important to define and implement new tests on these
%measurement infrastructure, it is also equally pertinent to not only be able
%to install, update and delete these tests but also configure the entire suite
%of probes using a standardized protocol over the network. The \ac{NETCONF}
%protocol \cite{rfc6241} is particularly designed to cater to this problem.
%Towards this end, we have built a \ac{NETCONF} server for the OpenWRT platform
%using the \texttt{libnetconf}
%\footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/libnetconf/}} library and tested the
%implementation using our NETCONF Python API \texttt{ncclient}
%\cite{sbhushan:2009}. This will allow automated deployment of measurement
%tests and remote management of their startup configurations.
