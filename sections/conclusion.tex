In our preliminary study, we have witnessed that a major portion of the
services in practicality centralize either on core content delivery networks
or major cloud platforms. We want to investigate this effect in more detail
and understand to what extend does this network aggregation and the eventual
user experience depend on the localization information. We want to take this
further by comparing the performance of IPv6 with respect to IPv4 and not only
define IPv6 related metrics but also identify \ac{CGN}s and/or several layers
of \ac{NAT}s enforced by the \ac{ISP} on the home gateway.

%Our current NETCONF server implementation for the SamKnows platform assumes
%the existence of an ssh server implementation that provides subsystem support.
%We would like to subvert this limitation and instead secure NETCONF exchanges
%over TLS \cite{draft-ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis-01}. We are also interested to
%define new YANG \cite{rfc6020} data models for configuring and scheduling the
%measurement tests for such large-scale broadband access measurements. These
%data models can be used with either \ac{NETCONF} or using a RESTful interface
%\cite{draft-bierman-netconf-yang-api-01}.
